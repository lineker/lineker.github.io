A new post for old news.
Last year I participated at Wearhacks Montreal 2014 and our project was basically using google glass + beacons.

Our main goal was to use wearable devices to some how incentivize people to go to museums by making it more interesting and easy to learn the background history of any art piece. **It really sucks to read each explanation on that little box right besides the art piece**

As clients wearing the google glass (our any other mobile device with bluetooth LTE)
a presentation would be offered about the art piece as soon as they get close to the piece. Each art piece would have a beacon that would notify clients that they are close to a new piece that has interactive content. Presentations could include text, videos, images and sound enhancing much of the museums experience we have today.

Here is our presentation:
